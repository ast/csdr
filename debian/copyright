Most of the code of libcsdr is under BSD license.
However, before the implementation of some algoritms, GPL-licensed code from
other applications have been reviewed. In order to eliminate any licesing
issues, these parts are placed under a different file. However, the library
is still fully functional with BSD-only code, altough having only
less-optimized versions of some algorithms.

It should also be noted that if you compile with -DUSE_FFTW and -DLIBCSDR_GPL
(as default), the GPL license would apply on the whole result.
